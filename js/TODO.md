## **To-Do List**

1. **Set Up React Frontend**

   - [ ] **Initialize React App**

     - Run `npx create-react-app frontend` in your project's root directory.
     - Ensure the React app runs by navigating to the `frontend` directory and running `npm start`.

   - [ ] **Clean Up Initial Files**

     - Remove unnecessary files from the React app (e.g., logos, boilerplate code).

2. **Implement Routing with React Router**

   - [ ] Install React Router:

     ```bash
     cd frontend
     npm install react-router-dom
     ```

   - [ ] Set up basic routes:

     - `/` - Home Page
     - `/login` - Login Page
     - `/register` - Registration Page
     - `/upload` - File Upload Page
     - `/files` - Media Browsing Page

3. **Implement Authentication**

   - [ ] **Create Authentication Context**

     - Use React Context API to create `AuthContext` for managing auth state.

   - [ ] **Build Login and Register Components**

     - Create forms for user input.
     - Implement state management with `useState`.

   - [ ] **Connect to Backend API**

     - Use `fetch` or `axios` to send login and registration requests to your backend.

   - [ ] **Handle JWT Tokens**

     - Store JWT tokens in `localStorage` or `cookies`.
     - Be cautious with security implications.

   - [ ] **Protect Routes**

     - Implement a `PrivateRoute` component to restrict access to authenticated users.

4. **Implement File Upload Functionality**

   - [ ] **Create Upload Component**

     - Use HTML5 `File` API to select files.
     - Implement file selection and upload handlers.

   - [ ] **Display Upload Progress**

     - Use `XMLHttpRequest` or `axios` to monitor upload progress.
     - Provide visual feedback to users.

   - [ ] **Send Files to Backend**

     - Ensure files are sent to the `/upload` endpoint on your server.

5. **Implement Media Browsing and Playback**

   - [ ] **Fetch Media Files**

     - Create an API endpoint to retrieve a list of media files.
     - Use `useEffect` to fetch data when the component mounts.

   - [ ] **Display Media Gallery**

     - Use a grid layout to display media thumbnails.
     - Implement pagination or infinite scroll if necessary.

   - [ ] **Implement Media Player**

     - Use HTML5 `<video>` or `<audio>` elements.
     - Allow users to play, pause, and seek within media.

   - [ ] **Implement Quality Selection**

     - Provide options for different media quality settings.
     - Adjust the media source based on user selection.

6. **Enhance User Experience**

   - [ ] **Implement Search and Filtering**

     - Allow users to search for media files by name or tags.
     - Provide filters for file types, upload dates, etc.

   - [ ] **Responsive Design**

     - Ensure the UI is responsive on different devices.

   - [ ] **Error Handling**

     - Display meaningful error messages.
     - Handle network errors gracefully.

7. **Secure Your Application**

   - [ ] **Validate User Input**

     - On both frontend and backend, validate inputs to prevent security issues.

   - [ ] **Implement Refresh Tokens**

     - Enhance authentication with refresh tokens for better security.

   - [ ] **Use HTTPS**

     - Configure your server to use HTTPS, especially if transmitting sensitive data.

8. **Testing**

   - [ ] **Write Unit Tests**

     - Use Jest and React Testing Library for frontend tests.

   - [ ] **Write Integration Tests**

     - Test the interaction between frontend and backend.

9. **Optimize Performance**

   - [ ] **Code Splitting**

     - Implement dynamic imports to reduce initial load time.

   - [ ] **Lazy Loading**

     - Lazy load components and media files.

   - [ ] **Caching**

     - Use browser caching and consider a service worker for offline capabilities.

10. **Dockerization**

    - [ ] **Update Dockerfile**

      - Ensure your Dockerfile builds both the frontend and backend.

    - [ ] **Test Docker Image**

      - Build and run your Docker image to test the application in a containerized environment.

11. **Documentation**

    - [ ] **Update README.md**

      - Provide clear instructions on setting up and running the project.

    - [ ] **API Documentation**

      - Document your API endpoints using tools like Swagger or API Blueprint.

12. **Version Control and Collaboration**

    - [ ] **Review .gitignore**

      - Ensure sensitive files and unnecessary directories (like `node_modules`) are ignored.

    - [ ] **Commit Regularly**

      - Commit changes with meaningful messages.

13. **Future Enhancements**

    - [ ] **Implement User Roles**

      - Differentiate access levels (e.g., admin vs. regular user).

    - [ ] **Integrate a Database ORM**

      - Use Prisma or Sequelize to prepare for scaling to PostgreSQL.

    - [ ] **Add User Profiles**

      - Allow users to manage their profiles and settings.

    - [ ] **Implement Notifications**

      - Notify users of upload status, new media, etc.
